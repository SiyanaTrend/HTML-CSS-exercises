            <span class="text">
                The northern lights most commonly occur within the geographic area beneath the auroral oval. It encompasses latitudes
                between 60 and 75 degrees and takes in Iceland, northern parts of Sweden, Finland, Norway, Russia, Canada and Alaska as
                well as southern Greenland.
